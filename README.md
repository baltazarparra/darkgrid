## What is caipora?

**caipora** is a 2D pixel-art roguelike set in the dark heart of Brazilian folklore.

You play as the **Caipora** — guardian of the forest, spirit of whistles, traps, and vengeance — awakening in a corrupted woodland where ancient pacts have been shattered. Every step on the grid is a choice. Every encounter can become hunt, punishment, flight, or enchantment.

The core mechanic is **timing-based combat** inspired by *Legend of Dragoon* and *Clair Obscur*:
- Press **Space** at the right moment to land a **critical hit** (2x–3x damage).
- Press **Space** at the right moment to **perfect dodge** an attack and **counter-attack**.

Every strike, dodge, and death is packed with visceral feedback: screen shake, blood particles, hit-stop frames, and brutal sound effects.

**Tone:** GORE / TERROR / SANGRENTO

## Running Locally

```bash
# Requires Godot 4.6+ installed at ~/.local/bin/godot
# Display :0 must be available (WSLg on Windows, native X11 on Linux)

~/.local/bin/godot --path .
```

### Running Tests

All harness commands live in the `Makefile`. Override the binary with `make test GODOT=/path/to/godot`.

```bash
make smoke    # headless smoke test
make test     # GUT regression gate
make export   # reproducible HTML5 build
make gate     # smoke + test (run before commit)
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

This project uses the **Godot MCP Server** (`@coding-solo/godot-mcp`) so AI agents can interact directly with the Godot editor and runtime.

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_scene` | Create a new `.tscn` file |
| `add_node` | Add a node to an existing scene |
| `save_scene` | Save changes to a scene |
| `run_project` | Run the game and capture output |
| `get_debug_output` | Read stdout/stderr from the running game |
| `stop_project` | Stop the running game |
| `launch_editor` | Open the Godot editor |

### Configuration

- **Kimi Code CLI:** `.kimi-code/mcp.json`
- **Cursor:** `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Wrapper script:** `scripts/mcp-wrapper.sh` (sets `GODOT_PATH`)

## Development Harness

This project follows **Harness Engineering** principles:

- **Feedforward:** `AGENTS.md` (root + per-folder) and `PLAN.md` guide the agent before it acts. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`, so every agent (Claude Code, Kimi, Cursor) reads the same source of truth.
- **Feedback:** Verification commands are codified in the `Makefile` (`make smoke`/`test`/`export`/`gate`) — not buried in prose — so they are stable and discoverable.
- **Memory:** Git commits, milestone tracking in `PLAN.md` (incl. a Known Issues section), and evolving `AGENTS.md`.
- **Tools:** Godot MCP, configured once in `.mcp.json` (canonical); `.cursor/` and `.kimi-code/` configs are symlinks to it.

Read `AGENTS.md` before contributing (human or agent).
